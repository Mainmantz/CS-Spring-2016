My task was setting up the structure of the game, getting the board and boxes setup to the point to where we could move them around into a more organized fashion. I also assited with the collisions and movements that Kellen implemeneted. Each of those tasks contributed to the final run of the game. 

The biggest technical challenge was getting the SD cards to read a sound file.

If I could do anything differently it would be to enable the players to get bigger after "eating" another box.
